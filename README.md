# PHP
Simple CRUD App

# Let's run that Composer app:
- "git clone" project locally
- all last changes are on "develop" branch
- pull the latest version of the branches
- in 'route' of your project launch "command prompt", "git bash" or similar
- run 'vagrant up' command
- after that you should be able to access application in your browser by typing "192.168.33.10" in address bar or how you set it(example:scotch.box)
- "scotch.box" will open homepage with information about our Employees
- "scotch.box/{some_id}" page will open page with information about Employee with that id
- if you hit non-existent URLs, you will get "404 page"
